# autoDisasterStateReporter
The idea is the brainchild of Rishi Gaurav Bhatnagar, he loves hacking around with hardware and social media.
####Motivation
The motivation for this project is the recent flood situation in Chennai. Media has completely ignore the situation there. You will not see them talking about it. Social media can be used to update people about situation of various places around the city.
#### Idea
Idea here is to create a network of camera bots that can update the situation of various sections of disaster areas using Social Media as the medium. Which is the first step to let the world know what the situation is.

###Status of the Hack
1. The image capturing and tweeting system has been built and tested.
2. More intergrations can be built.
3. The timings for the update is 6 hours apart.

###Contribution possibilities
1. Make it more efficient so it is lighter on power usage.
2. Use this as a boiler plate, map the areas using GPS location and put it up on a map.
3. Test the code.
